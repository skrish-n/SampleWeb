				lived about 8,000 BC. In time the people of Romania learned to farm
				and then they learned to make bronze tools. Eventually they learned
				to use iron. From about 600 BC the ancient Greeks traded with the
				people they called Getae. They founded settlements on the coast of
				Romania.</p>

				With an area of 238,391 square kilometres (92,043 sq mi), Romania is
				the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest
				in Europe. It lies between latitudes 43° and 49° N, and longitudes
				20° and 30° E. The terrain is distributed roughly equally between
				mountains, hills and plains. <img alt="topo"
					src="Images/Romaniatopo.png">The Carpathian Mountains
				dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching
				above 2,000 m or 6,600 ft, and the highest point at Moldoveanu Peak
				(2,544 m or 8,346 ft, pictured right).[127] They are surrounded by
				the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus and Carpathian Basin and
				Wallachian plains. 47% of the country's land area is covered with
				natural and semi-natural ecosystems.[128] There are almost 10,000
				km2 (3,900 sq mi) (about 5% of the total area) of protected areas in
				Romania covering 13 national parks and three biosphere reserves. <img

			<h2>History</h2>
			<img alt="history" src="Images/romhis.jpg">
			<p>Romania's territory has been inhabited from times long past.
				It is here where, in the Neolithic, some of the most prolific
				European cultures, Cucuteni and Gumelnita, flourished. Known by the
				Greeks under the name of Gets and by the Romans as Dacians, the
				ancient inhabitants of the present Romanian territory were first
				mentioned by Herodotus. Dacia was at the peak of its power under
				King Decebal (87-106 AD). After a first confrontation during the
				reign of Domitian (87-89), two extremely tough wars were necessary
				(101-102 and 105-106) to the Roman Empire, at the peak of its power
				under Emperor Trajan (98-117) to defeat Decebal and turn most of his
				kingdom into the Roman province called Dacia. At the time when the
				Daco-Roman ethno-cultural symbiosis was achieved and finalised in
				the 6-7th centuries by the formation of the Romanian people, in the
				2-4th centuries, the Daco-Romans adopted Christianity in a Latin
				garb. During the 4-13th centuries the Romanian people were under the
				domination of migrating peoples - the Getae, the Huns, the Gepidae,
				the Avars, the Slavs, the Petchenegs, the Cumanians, the Tartars,
				and, amidst migrating waves, miraculously preserved its unity,
				including that of its language, spoken without dialectal variations.

				Starting from the 10th century, Romanians lived in three
				principalities: Vallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania. Until the 13th
				century, Hungarians occupied Transylvania and made it part of the
				Hungarian kingdom. In the14th century, a new power will rise: The
				Ottoman Empire. During many centuries, romanian voivodes like Mircea
				the Old, Vlad the Impaler (the legendary Dracula), Stephen the Great
				and Holy, struggled with ottomans. In 1600, for a short time,
				Michael the Brave (1593-1601) united all three Romanian
				principalities for the first time. Only in 1859, just two
				principalities, Valachia and Moldavia, succeeded to reunite in one
				country, under the name of Romania. First voivode of Romania was
				Alexandru Ioan Cuza. In 1866, the new constitution proclaimed
				Romania a constitutional monarchy. The first king of Romania was,
				Carol I of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a relative of the royal family
				of Prussia. In May 9/21, 1877 Romania declared its full state of
				independence. After the World War I, in 1918, Romania united with
				Basarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania lead to the creation of the
				Great Romania. Romania was recognized as one big state at the
				international peace treaty from Paris in 1919. After World War II,
				Romania lost in favor of the USSR, Basarabia (now Republic of
				Moldova) and Northern Bukovina. The whole power in Romania was taken
				over by the communists supported by the USSR. The first communist
				leader was Gheorghe Gheorghiu Dej. Next was Nicolae Ceausescu with
				his wife, Elena until the revolution of December 1989. Now, the
				democracy was re-established and the country joined European Union
				in 2007.</p>

				<h4>Population</h4>
				<p>Romania's population declined steadily in recent years, from
					21.7 million in 2002 to 19.9 million in 2014.More specifically, in
					the last decade, the population of Romania decreased by 7.5%, the
					most important moment for the country's demography being 2008, when
					the number of inhabitants dropped by 600,000 people.Among the
					causes of population decline are high mortality, low fertility rate
					after 1989, and emigration.For the entire period 1990-2006
					estimated population loss tops 1.5 million. But it is likely to be
					higher, given the explosion of migration for work after 2001 and
					the tendency of some migrants to settle permanently in the
					countries where they live.</p>
